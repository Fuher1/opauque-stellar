# Integrate: ZK Reputation

End-to-end on-chain zero-knowledge reputation: an authority registers a schema, an
issuer attests to a stealth identity, and a holder proves they possess the
attestation — verified **inside a Soroban contract** — without revealing which
identity holds it. See [ZK Reputation](/concepts/zk-reputation) for the model.

## Prerequisites

```sh
npm install @opaquecash/stellar "@stellar/stellar-sdk" "@noble/curves@^1" "@noble/hashes@^1" circomlibjs snarkjs
```

- `circomlibjs` + `snarkjs` — witness + Groth16 proof generation.
- **Circuit artifacts** — v2 `stealth_reputation.wasm` + `.zkey` via an
  `ArtifactResolver` (required for `prove` / `proveAndVerify`).

```ts
import { OpaqueClient, keypairSigner, urlArtifactResolver } from "@opaquecash/stellar";

const opaque = new OpaqueClient({
  network: "testnet",
  signer: keypairSigner(process.env.STELLAR_SECRET!),
  artifacts: urlArtifactResolver({ baseUrl: "https://your-cdn.example" }), // serves circuits/v2/*
});
```

## Roles

- **Authority** — registers the schema (the trait's shape). `signer` = authority.
- **Issuer** — attests that a stealth identity has the trait. `signer` = issuer.
- **Holder** — proves possession and verifies on-chain. `signer` = anyone (the
  proof is what's checked, not the caller).

## Step 1 — Authority registers a schema

A schema defines the trait's fields. The id is derived deterministically from the
authority + name + fields.

```ts
const { schemaId, txHash } = await opaque.schemas.register({
  name: "credit",
  fieldDefinitions: "u64 score, bool verified", // "type name" comma-separated
  revocable: true,
  schemaExpiryLedger: 6_000_000,
});
// schemaId — 32-byte id; share it with issuers
```

Supported field types: `bool`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `string`, `pubkey`.

## Step 2 — Issuer attests to a stealth identity

The issuer encodes the field values and attests them to a holder's stealth
address hash (a 32-byte identifier for the holder's stealth identity).

```ts
await opaque.reputation.attest({
  schemaId,
  stealthAddressHash,                 // 32-byte hash of the holder's stealth identity
  fieldValues: { score: "780", verified: "true" },
  fieldDefinitions: "u64 score, bool verified", // same shape as the schema
  expirationLedger: 6_000_000,
});
```

The attestation is recorded on-chain. Attestations form a Poseidon Merkle tree
whose root an indexer publishes on the reputation-verifier (Step 4 needs that).

## Step 3 — Holder generates a proof

The holder proves possession of the trait, scoped to an **external nullifier**
(your application context — prevents the same identity proving twice in that
context).

```ts
const proof = await opaque.reputation.prove({
  attestationId,                 // schema id field from the attestation (32-byte hex or bigint)
  stealthPrivKey,                // the holder's stealth private key (32 bytes)
  externalNullifier: 42n,        // your app context id (must fit u64)
  attestationWitness: { issuerPkX, traitDataHash, nonce }, // private fields for the actual leaf
  publisherProof,                // { root, pathElements, pathIndices } from GET /v1/reputation/root/:leaf
});
// proof.proofA/B/C, merkleRoot, attestationId, nullifierHash, externalNullifier, publicSignals
```

## Step 4 — Verify on-chain

Submit the proof to the reputation-verifier contract, which enforces root
validity + nullifier-replay protection and runs the Groth16 check via the BN254
host functions.

```ts
// the published root must already cover this attestation:
const root = await opaque.reputation.getLatestRoot();
if (!root) {
  // indexer hasn't published a root including this attestation yet — wait.
}

const txHash = await opaque.reputation.verifyOnChain(proof);
// reverts (ContractError) on nullifier replay (#4) or expired/stale root (#2)
```

Or do both in one call:

```ts
const txHash = await opaque.reputation.proveAndVerify({
  attestationId,
  stealthPrivKey,
  externalNullifier: 42n,
});
```

::: tip Already have a proof?
`verifyOnChain` accepts any proof bundle of the right shape — you can generate it
elsewhere (even without the `artifacts` resolver) and just submit it here.

## Full end-to-end script

```ts
import { OpaqueClient, keypairSigner, urlArtifactResolver } from "@opaquecash/stellar";

// authority registers the schema
const authority = new OpaqueClient({ network: "testnet", signer: keypairSigner(AUTHORITY_SECRET) });
const { schemaId } = await authority.schemas.register({
  name: "credit", fieldDefinitions: "u64 score, bool verified",
  revocable: true, schemaExpiryLedger: 6_000_000,
});

// issuer attests
const issuer = new OpaqueClient({ network: "testnet", signer: keypairSigner(ISSUER_SECRET) });
await issuer.reputation.attest({
  schemaId, stealthAddressHash, fieldValues: { score: "780", verified: "true" },
  fieldDefinitions: "u64 score, bool verified", expirationLedger: 6_000_000,
});

// holder proves + verifies on-chain
const holder = new OpaqueClient({
  network: "testnet",
  signer: keypairSigner(HOLDER_SECRET),
  artifacts: urlArtifactResolver({ baseUrl: ARTIFACT_BASE_URL }),
});
const txHash = await holder.reputation.proveAndVerify({
  attestationId, stealthPrivKey, externalNullifier: 42n,
  attestationWitness, publisherProof,
});
```

## Notes & errors

- `NotWiredError` from `prove` → no `artifacts` resolver configured (you can still
  `verifyOnChain` a precomputed proof).
- `RootUnavailableError` / null root → the indexer hasn't published a root
  including the attestation yet; retry.
- `ContractError` `#4` → nullifier replay (already proven in this context); `#2` →
  expired/stale root.
- `attestationId` and `externalNullifier` must fit in `u64`.

If proof generation or on-chain verification fails and the above doesn't
cover it, see

for the full set of failure signatures (artifact fetch, memory, stale root,
input mismatch) mapped to causes and fixes, including the on-chain
`Groth16Verifier`/`ReputationVerifier` error code reference.
